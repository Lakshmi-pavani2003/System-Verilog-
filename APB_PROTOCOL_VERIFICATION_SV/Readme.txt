Description of APB Protocol Version 3

1. APB3 Protocol Overview
The Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) Version 3, part of the AMBA (Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture) family, is designed for low-bandwidth, low-power communication between the processor and peripherals. It offers a simple, efficient interface for slower peripherals like UARTs, GPIOs, and other control registers.

2. Key Features of APB3
Signal Set:

PCLK: Peripheral clock.
PRESETn: Active low reset.
PSEL: Peripheral select signal.
PENABLE: Indicates the access phase.
PWRITE: Specifies write operation when high.
PWDATA: Data bus for write operations.
PRDATA: Data bus for read operations.
PREADY: Signals when the transfer is ready.
PSLVERR: Indicates an error condition.
Enhanced Functionality:

Wait States: Controlled using PREADY for slower peripherals.
Error Signaling: PSLVERR provides error status for failed transfers.
Pipeline Optimization: Setup and access phases ensure efficient use of clock cycles.
3. Design Implementation in Verilog
The Verilog implementation of APB3 follows an FSM-based architecture to handle different phases of operation:

IDLE: Waits for a valid PSEL and PENABLE.
SETUP: Prepares for data transfer.
ACCESS: Executes read/write operation.
TRANSFER: Completes the transaction and resets the state.
Key Functionalities:

Read/Write Memory:
Write: Data is written to memory when PWRITE is high.
Read: Data is read from memory when PWRITE is low.
Error Detection:
Invalid addresses trigger PSLVERR.
Overflow and underflow conditions are managed via counters.
4. SystemVerilog Testbench Description
The APB testbench is structured to thoroughly test all functional scenarios of the APB3 design. It includes various components for stimulus generation, signal driving, and monitoring.

4.1 Testbench Components
Testbench Top Module (apb_tb):

Instantiates the APB DUT and test environment.
Generates and applies stimuli through test scenarios.
Interface (apb_if):

Manages signal synchronization using clocking blocks.
Defines two modports for driving (mp_bfm) and monitoring (mp_mon) APB transactions.
Test Generator (apb_gen):

Dynamically generates test sequences.
Supports multiple scenarios:
apb_base_test: Basic operations.
apb_overflow: Tests write operations with memory overflow.
apb_underflow: Tests read operations with empty memory.
apb_invalid_address: Access to invalid memory locations to verify error handling.
Driver (apb_bfm):

Converts high-level test transactions into APB protocol signals.
Drives the PSEL, PENABLE, PADDR, PWDATA, PWRITE signals.
Monitor (apb_mon):

Observes and captures APB signals.
Stores transactions in a mailbox for coverage analysis.
Coverage Module (apb_cov):

Tracks coverage metrics using covergroups.
Key signals like PSEL, PWRITE, PADDR, and error flags are monitored.
Functional bins ensure all valid and edge cases are tested.
4.2 Test Scenarios
apb_base_test:

Verifies basic read and write operations.
Checks for correct data transfer without errors.
apb_overflow:

Simulates continuous write operations to test memory full condition.
Verifies PSLVERR when attempting writes beyond capacity.
apb_underflow:

Tests reads from an empty memory.
Ensures PRDATA outputs X and PSLVERR is asserted.
apb_invalid_address:

Generates out-of-bound addresses.
Ensures correct PSLVERR flagging for invalid memory access.

Key Files and Scripts
Run Scripts
run.do:

Compiles and simulates a single test.
Saves coverage using UCDB format.
run_regr.do:

Automates regression for all tests in testname_list.
Applies exclusions via exclusion.do.
Supporting Files
testname_list: Lists the test cases for regression.
exclusion.do: Specifies bins to exclude from coverage.

Functional Coverage
Functional coverage tracks all APB operations:

Signal Coverage:
Control Signals: PSEL, PENABLE, PWRITE.
Data Signals: PWDATA, PRDATA.
Error Signals: PSLVERR.
Scenario Coverage:
Ensures every operational case is tested, including corner cases like overflow, underflow, and invalid address access.

Tools Used
